k-nearest neighbors algorithm demonstration

File Structure:
readme.txt
glass_zoo_knn
analysis
total_result

Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
glass_zoo_knnScript file in R language covering two scenario (Zoo and Glass)
total_result - It is an set of results of accuracy figure on different k values  
analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on salary dataset

objective:- 
(1) Prepare a model for glass classification using KNN

Data.
(2) Implement a KNN model to classify the animals in to categorie
. 

Note :- I have added some png files which are the different graphs on both the datasets for EDA and result observation purpose. Also added the snapshot dataset.
